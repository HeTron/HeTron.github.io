        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            As an experienced professional transitioning from sales and service industries into the dynamic field of data
science, I bring a unique blend of skills honed over years in management, customer relations, and healthcare
recruiting. My background in improving business performance across various markets has instilled in me a keen
analytical mindset and an ability to understand and leverage data trends for strategic decision-making. My recent
completion of a Data Science bootcamp from 4Geeks Academy has further solidified my technical expertise,
including proficiency in building both supervised and unsupervised learning models and Python. I am excited to
apply my strong foundation in interpersonal and communication skills, along with my new-found technical
acumen, to drive insightful data-driven solutions with a company I can grow with.
